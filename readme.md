# THIS IS THE Student Knowledge Object FOR CODEWORDS 2020

## This SKO will include what I leart & explored during this course, based on weekly visual and written documentation / reflection

**Brief Statement for my SKO**

I want to work in the field of mass entertainment in the future, such as TV shows,
games and animation, as a motion and video effect designer. And Learning codes is essential for this.  

Although being study online, Codewords still gave a lot of insights. Share research and ideas in
a common space, receive feedback from classmates and lecturers help me a lot not only in
developing my design outcomes, but also gathering useful information.

Two main projects we made during this semester was "Digital reading-performance of House of Leaves through video games" and "Use codes to perform a piece text".
It is the first time that I create a performance through a video game. It was a unique experience for me. Reading through digital space is a new concept for me as well. I liked this idea to convey messages and even articles through performance in video games or other digital space. Although as for me, I still prefer reading a physical book. But I think compared with reading electronic readings on-screen, people may prefer reading through digital space. Therefore, I think this project is probably related to the future and is meaningful to explore with.

I explored a lot on After Effects during this semester as well. I obsessed with creating fancy 3D and motion effects using ae. I think motion effects are based on codes. Except for creating visual effects, it can also make sketches interactive. This is very powerful as users can use keyboards, mouses or even fingers to interact with the contents through the screen. This is the area that I feel passionate to explore with and I'll study it after this course as well.

I've been enjoying codewords a lot through this semester. It's very interesting for me to use codes and create design outcomes. Although I also encountered challenges, such as I had no idea about GitHub when I was introduced by it. My internet wasn't very stable so I sometimes didn't catch up during class. I had difficulties in writing codes, especially finding out the information of functions that I need.

However, the process of learning new things is always full of challenges. The good thing is to gain new knowledge and be ready to explore more in future practice.

Overall, I loved the journey of codewords with all talented classmates and tutors. I'll continue learning codes and apply them to my design practices in the future!
