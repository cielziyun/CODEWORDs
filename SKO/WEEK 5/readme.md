# CODEWORDS WEEK 5

## Digital performance
The morning class was very relaxing! Every group showed fantastic performance outcomes. I really liked the video editing of the Animal Crossing group, and how the Second life group tell a story using the method of parallel to the narrative. Below is a screenshot and video link to the performance of my group.

## Reading
We then worked in small groups and read the readings provides by Andy and Karen through "A Reader". [link to A Reader](http://digbeyond.com/readme/phplist.php?course=Code-Words) There seems to have a lot of interesting articles. I randomly read some and finaly I was reading McKenzie Wark's Abstraction/class. It was an impressful reading for me. Below is a summary of the texts.

# REFLECTION
Seeing the performances of other groups gave me a lot of insights. Not only the way that they intepret a story were creative, but their video edits and use of sound effects were creative as well.

It is the first time that I create a performance through a video game. It was a unique experience for me. I had a lot of fun during these weeks.
Reading through digital space is a new concept for me as well. I liked this idea, to convey messages and even articles through performance in video games or other digital space. Although as for me, I still prefer reading a physical book. But I think compared with reading electronic readings on-screen, people may prefer reading through digital space, just like reading through a digital performance. 

I randomly clicked on some articles and finally I was reading McKenzie Wark's Abstraction/class. The texts that "All people fell in relations with conflict, collusion and compromise resonated with me so I decided to choose this reading. And I loved how Wark uses metaphor to describe new things as "abstraction" and its relationship with history.
