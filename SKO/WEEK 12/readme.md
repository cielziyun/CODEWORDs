## REFLECTION
It was very impressive to see all my classmate's amazing results of sketches. Their sketches not only convey the texts well but also have strong visual effects. I look back to my sketch and I think I may focus on the texts itself too much and lose a few visual effects.

I explored a lot on After Effects during this semester. I obsessed with creating fancy 3D and motion effects using ae. However, when I saw my classmates not only created nice 3d effects through processing but also made the design interactive. I realized I could make a lot more by using processing and its codes. This is the area that I feel passionate to explore with and I'll study it after this course as well. I've been enjoying codewords a lot through this semester. I liked learning new things and it's the first time that I learn about codes. It's very interesting for me to use codes and create design outcomes by it. Although I also encountered challenges, such as I had no idea about GitHub when I was introduced by it. My internet has always been interrupted so I sometimes didn't catch up during class. I had difficulties in writing codes, especially finding out the information of functions that I need.

However, the process of learning new things is always full of challenges. I've been wondered why I need to use codes to create visual effects rather than using motion design tools. I now realized that codes are a very powerful tool, especially for making things interactive. I've been "thinking inside box" sometimes, I liked to think and work by myself so I always didn't know what other people are doing and where they were at. It reminds me to connect with the bigger community so that I gain feedbacks and information from them as well.

Overall, I loved the journey of codewords with all talented classmates and tutors. I'll continue learning codes and apply them to my design practices in the future!
