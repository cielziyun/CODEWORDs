## REFLECTION
It was very impressive to see all my classmate's amazing results of sketches. Their sketches not only convey the texts well but also have strong visual effects.
I look back to my sketch and I think I may focus on the texts itself too much and lose a few visual effects. 
I explored a lot on After Effects during this semester. I obsessed with creating fancy 3D and motion effects using ae. However, when I saw my classmates not only created nice 3d effects through processing but also made the design interactive. I realized I could make a lot more by using processing and its codes. This is the area that I feel passionate to explore with and I'll study it after this course as well.
