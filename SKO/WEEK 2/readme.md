# CODEWORDS WEEK 2

## Typeface
We were introduced with modular typeface designs at the beginning of the class. We've also been working in small groups, research furthermore typeface designs and shared with the class. Below are some of the typefaces impressed and inspired me a lot.

## Processing
By sharing homework of initials sketches through slides, we learnt from other classmates's codes and further developed our own codes.

## Visual games / Digital performance
Determined some visual games that we liked and can be utillised for the first assignment. We were going to create a digital performance using language.
Digital spaces include Sims, Animal crossing, Minecrafts, Second life, Club Penguin. 

## House of Leaves
Here comes to the reading part! House of Leaves tells a horror story. It is a long reading so we were divided into 6 groups and each group should interpret one chapter from the reading. My group chose chapter 6. It is a chapter related to animals, records the supernatural things that happened to the animals in the host family, and describes Navidson's horror experience when he researched that place with his colleges. 
The digital space in Minecraft.

## Introduction to Github
Karen and Andy walked us through the basic functions of github. It is kinkd of like a place where I can store documents and codes. I established my first repository and explored a bit of chatacters and paragraphs of using github.

# REFLECTION
It is a good chance to see lots of impress typeface designs, as sometimes it's difficult to find impactful information by a single person. The typefaces that Andy showed to us were very impressed, I particularly loved geometric liked typefaces, they looked tidy and are read friendly.
Performances through digital spaces are very new for me; However, I felt wired when I saw the performance through youtube that Andy shared with the class. Therefore, I disregard the digital spaces of Sims and Second life to avoid the queer feelings and choose Minecraft at last. I thought by using Minecraft, I can probably make a more lovely and less stressful performance outcome.
