*Used texts: “We are the hackers of abstractions. We produce new concepts, new productions, new sensations.”  ”Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.”
“The producing classes - farmers, workers, hackers - struggle against the expropriating classes - pastoralists, capitalists, vectoralists"-but these successive ruling classes struggle also among themselves.”*

*Used texts: "The sectoral world is dynamic. All classes enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise.”*

**Clip 3**

*Used texts: “Their relations are not necessarily dialectical. Classes may form alliances of mutual interest against other classes, or may arrive at a “historic compromise,” for a time. Yet despite pauses and setbacks, the class struggle drives history into abstraction and abstraction into history."*

**Pseudocode**

We learnt and practiced writing a pseudocode last week. Below is a screenshot of pseudocode for my major project at this stage.

## Karen's live coding

Explored more on p5js libraries. Below is Karen's outcome, Which I spent a lot of time to understand. I loved this effect so much.

# REFLECTION
Week 8 is a busy week. I had capstone projects and Japanese exams in due. I also experimented with After effects a lot during this semester. I found that expressions are also used in this software. I watched Andrew Kramer's videos [link to website](https://www.videocopilot.net/) and noticed that he creates plug-ins for After effects and some other softwares by writing functions. This is interesting as I realised that coding is relevant with many design fields and benefit designers in several aspects.
