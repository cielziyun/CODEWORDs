## Second milestone of major project

**Paper-prototype**

*Used texts: “We are the hackers of abstractions. We produce new concepts, new productions, new sensations.”  ”Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.”
“The producing classes - farmers, workers, hackers - struggle against the expropriating classes - pastoralists, capitalists, vectoralists"-but these successive ruling classes struggle also among themselves.”*

*Used texts: "The sectoral world is dynamic. All classes enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise.”*

**Clip 3**

*Used texts: “Their relations are not necessarily dialectical. Classes may form alliances of mutual interest against other classes, or may arrive at a “historic compromise,” for a time. Yet despite pauses and setbacks, the class struggle drives history into abstraction and abstraction into history."*

**Pseudocode**

We learnt and practiced to write a pseudocode last week. Below is a screenshot of pseudocode for my major project at this stage.

## Karen's live coding

We explored more on p5js libraries in this week. Below is Karen's codes and functions. This sketch used function of "class", "jitter" and etc. I loved this effect very much! I also spent time study it after class.

# REFLECTION
Week 8 is a busy week. I had capstone projects and Japanese exams in due. I also experimented with After effects a lot during this semester. I found that expressions are also used in this software. I watched Andrew Kramer's videos [link to the website](https://www.videocopilot.net/) and noticed that he creates plug-ins for After effects by writing functions. Although I didn't understand how to achieve that, I think codes may be a useful tool in my future design career.

After class, I tried to use p5js and follow my paper prototype to create the same results from it. However, I failed to combine every single sketch together. I think it will be much convenient to do it using AE. Therefore, it's less meaningful for me to stick with my paper prototype. I changed my methods of developing my codes, to search for functions according to the effects that I need for my projects.
