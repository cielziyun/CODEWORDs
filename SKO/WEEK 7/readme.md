# CODEWORDS WEEK 7

### Structure and summerise-Key passages from texts

"We are the hackers of abstractions. We produce new concepts, new productions, new sensations."
"Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things."
"The sectoral world is dynamic."
"All classes enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise. Their relations are not necessarily dialectical. Classes may form alliances of mutual interest against other classes, or may arrive at a “historic compromise,” for a time. Yet despite pauses and setbacks, the class struggle drives history into abstraction and abstraction into history."
