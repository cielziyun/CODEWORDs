# CODEWORDS WEEK 7

## First millestone of major project

**My chosen texts**: McKenzie's Abstraction/class："We are the hackers of abstractions. We produce new concepts, new productions, new sensations. Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world, not always great things, or even good things, but new things. The sectoral world is dynamic. Classes may form alliances of mutual interest against other classes, or may arrive at a “historic compromise,” for a time. The producing classes struggle against the expropriating classes，but these successive ruling classes struggle also among themselves. All classes enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise. Yet despite pauses and setbacks, the class struggle drives history into abstraction and abstraction into history."

**Reason for choosing McKenzie's Abstraction/class**: I liked these texts because Wark creatively explained how abstraction and history accomplished each other by using metaphor. He focused on the good side of human activities, whether its conflict, compromise or collusion, he thinks they are the causes of new things and promote the development of the society. I liked the way that he made a political analysis sounds imaginative but thoughtful.

## Paper-prototype
**Prototype based on "conflict, collusion and compromise" from McKenzie Wark's Abstraction/class**

**Mindmap of the concept: "struggles between/inside classes dirves history into abstraction (new things), then abstraction into history**

## Refine paper prototypes -- use words only
**My idea is to express "conflict,collusion,compromise between and inside class", an idea is to use texts twist to represent the concept of "struggle"**

## Karen's live coding
Introduced by p5js libraries, p5js references and how to import sounds to a p5js sketch. Below is a sketch with sounds.

# REFLECTION
Mindmaps help me structure the ideas. Paper prototype was a good method to structure the texts. 
P5js libraries and references are very helpful tools. Such as p5.sound and p5.particle, they help to make the original sketch more impactful and complex.
