# CODEWORDS WEEK 3

## Electronic Literature
We learnt about various forms of electronic literature, includes texts spin, generative texts, animated texts, twsit texts and etc. 
We then worked in small groups and research for this topic a bit further, below are some research that I found.

Later in the class, we explored a bit about AI Dungeon, a software which can automatically generate texts and stories.

## Karen's Live coding 
Then Karen walked us through a whole process of coding.

## Scripts for House of Leaves Chapter 6

I wrote a script for chapter 6 which lists the scenes that my group can act for, and typed the texts to a shared document so people in my group can get acess to it.

# REFLECTION
Electronic literature gave me a lot insights of how to intepret texts into performed language. By creating effects of texts spin, random texts and etc, the outcomes of texts can also be impactful and meaningful. 
Karen's live coding is fantastic to me. The sketch is much more complex and challenging. I watched tutorials from youtube and learnt more knowledge of coding, including "random" and "rotate".
My digital performance group was facing a technical issue. We couldn't join the same Minecraft world which means we were unable to act in the game and video our performances. We thought we may need to apply for an extension if we still couldn't fix this problem :(
