# CODEWORDS WEEK 1

## Words
We were sharing our most recent readings with a group during this section. It's been a long time that I haven't read books. I was a book lover when I was in secondary and high school. Some of my favourite writers are Marquez, Calvino and Milan Kundera. The most recent book I read was a horror book called "the turn of the screw", written by Herny James. It tells a story of a young female family teacher meets with a little girl and boy, who's been connected with the ghosts of previous family teacher and steward. I loved how Herny portraits the characters of the little girl and boy, he describes them as incredibly clever and lovely. They have a secret connection with ghosts, so they usually tell lies but at the same time pacify the family teacher so well and make her obsessed with them.

## Minecraft
Later in the class, we took a walk in "mini Melbourne" through Minecraft. It was amazing because the mini Melbourne almost restored the look of Melbourne city, RMIT University and the flinders station.

## Processing
For the last half of week 1 class, we were introduced to processing. We started with p5js mode, a beginner friendly javascript. 
It was the first time I get in touch with coding. I felt curious about its functions and what design outcomes can be made by this tool. 
I learnt some basic coding knowledge and skills from Lynda.com. Below is my outcome.

# REFLECTION
The process of learning to write codes is very interesting. It reminds me of math. Sketches include lines, shapes are based on positions, which is very similar with coordinates in math. I felt easy to understand the functions of codes and it motivates me a lot to explore more about it.
