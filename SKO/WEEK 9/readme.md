# CODEWORD WEEK 9

## Establish codes
**Process**

1. List all effects that I may use for the project
2. Find the corresponding examples and references from p5js and websites
3. Experiment with my texts

**Websites and resources that I looked at**

I wanted to focus on the texts that I organized from the reading material. Therefore, I looked at functions in relation to texts order particularly.

**Texts**

[link to split](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/split)
[link to array of words](https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/B1iYPo6Kf)
[link to text] (https://p5js.org/zh-Hans/reference/#/p5/text)

I also looked at functions relates to objects movements. I wonder whether I can displace objects with texts and make same results by using texts. 

**Motion**

[link to objetos]/(https://p5js.org/es/examples/objects-objects-2.html#)
[link to array of objects] (https://p5js.org/es/examples/objects-array-of-objects.html)
[link to array of multiple objects](https://p5js.org/examples/objects-multiple-objects.html)

Furthermore, I wanted to set time for texts to appear and disappear.

**Time**
