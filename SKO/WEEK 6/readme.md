# CODEWORDS WEEK 6

For first half of the class, we did prototype for games. It was very interesting to see Andy explained how the game "Pong" works and can be related with coding. The game my group chosed was "SNAKE", a memory of my childhood.

### First millestone for major project

Reason for choosing McKenzie's Abstraction/class: The idea of everyone enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise resonates with me.
