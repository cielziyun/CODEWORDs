# CODEWORDS WEEK 6

## Decide on a piece of critical theory
**My chosen texts**: McKenzie's Abstraction/class："We are the hackers of abstractions. We produce new concepts, new productions, new sensations. Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world, not always great things, or even good things, but new things. The sectoral world is dynamic. Classes may form alliances of mutual interest against other classes, or may arrive at a “historic compromise,” for a time. The producing classes struggle against the expropriating classes，but these successive ruling classes struggle also among themselves. All classes enter into relations of conflict, collusion and compromise. Yet despite pauses and setbacks, the class struggle drives history into abstraction and abstraction into history."

**Reason for choosing McKenzie's Abstraction/class**: I liked these texts because Wark creatively explained how abstraction and history accomplished each other using metaphor. He focused on the good side of human activities, whether its conflict, compromise or collusion, he thinks they are the causes of new things and promote the development of the society. I liked the way that he made a political analysis sounds imaginative but thoughtful in the meantime.

## Paper prototype
Later in the class, we made prototype for 2D games. We worked in small groups. My group made paper prototypes for "SNAKE".

## Explored github for the rest of the class/do some more coding with longer texts

# REFLECTION
Making paper prototype helps me to understand how 2D video games work. They are based on functions and I realised I can even deisgn my own game as well using codes. That was very fun. 

In this week, we learnt how to apply longer texts to p5js sketch. Karen's live coding session were very helpful again! The "random" and "mouse" function were useful and helpful as well.
