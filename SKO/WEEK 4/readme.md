# CODEWORDS WEEK 4

## Karen's live coding
We learnt how to load fonts to the sketch in this week. The knowledge includes "preload" and "loadFont". We also explores more coding functions. Below are screenshots of texts display and texts spin.

## Digital performance WIP

Luckyly, my group members were able to join in the same world! We've been discussed about the division of work. Amy and Tom will perform in the game and video the performances. I'll edit the videos and upload it to youtube. 
Below are screenshots of the digital space that my group will perform at.

## REFLECTION
Karen presented this week's coding session with a more detailed methods and were very helpful for me. I had a deeper understanding of how texts can be intepreted through p5js sketches. By applying rotation, vary font sizes, I can make the sketch more visual impactful, these are very interesting to explore with.
I felt so lucky that my group finally find methods to complete the performance. I also enjoyed the process of editing videos.
