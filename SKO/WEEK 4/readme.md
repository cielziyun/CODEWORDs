## Digital performance WIP

Luckyly, my group members were able to join in the same world! We've been discussed about the division of work. Amy and Tom will perform in the game and video the performances. I'll edit the videos and upload it to youtube. 
Below are screenshots of the digital space that my group will perform at.
