# CODEWORDS WEEK 4

## Karen's live coding
We learnt how to load fonts to the sketch in this week. The knowledge includes "preload" and "loadFont". We also explores more coding functions. Below are screenshots of texts display and texts spin.

## Digital performance WIP

Luckyly, my group members were able to join in the same world! We've been discussed about the division of work. Amy and Tom will perform in the game and video the performances. I'll edit the videos and upload it to youtube. 
Below are screenshots of the digital space that my group will perform at.

## REFLECTION
Karen presented this week's coding session with more detailed methods and was very helpful for me. I had a more clear understanding of how texts can be interpreted through p5js sketches and make it variable.

In this week, I accidentally lost all the files that I stored in my desktop... I lost all materials for my elective, Capstone and Codewords. Fortunately, I kept some screenshots in my mobile and I also used p5js web editor and saved some of my code works. I'll never put files in desktop from now...

However, I felt so lucky that my group finally find methods to complete the performance! Andy also provided us with a lot of help. Really appreatiate that. I also enjoyed the process of editing videos.
